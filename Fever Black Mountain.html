<h2 id="prisonofthemanticoret">Prison of the Manticore</h2>
<p><em>Deep in the dark mountain is a shrine to a saint whose name is long forgotten. This sinless saint’s body was cremated and the ashes were sealed in a silver flask. Opening the flask releases the saint’s sleeping spirit, who will grant its deliverer a single wish. At least that’s the legend they tell in the gloomy village at the foot of the mountain. The truth is the villagers send strangers there to appease the evil things that live there.</em> <img src="shrinemap.png" /></p>
<h3 id="broken-stone-door">1. Broken Stone Door</h3>
<p>A heavy stone door lies broken on the ground if from of an arched stone frame. Hot air blows from the dark passage that leads south to the Hall of Footsteps (#2).</p>
<h3 id="hall-of-footsteps">2. Hall of Footsteps</h3>
<p>Foot shaped grooves are worn into the stone floor, as if people have walked in a circle here for centuries.</p>
<h3 id="bird-feeders">3. Bird Feeders</h3>
<p>Roughly a hundred wooden bird feeders hang from hooks in the ceiling. A cloud of humming birds buzz around the ceiling, producing a disorienting roar and breeze. 2d6 Centipede Men are trying to catch and eat the quick birds, to no avail.</p>
<h3 id="the-candelabrum">4. The Candelabrum</h3>
<p>A large candelabrum made from human bones. Four fat unlit candles stand on four skulls, the now-dried wax has dripped down around the craniums, into the eye sockets. If a candle is lit the skull beneath will be able to speak. These magic candles work with any skull.</p>

<h3 id="remnants-of-lost-travelers">5. Remnants of Lost Travelers</h3>
<p>Clothing and items are piled up in the center of the room. Four Crimson Monks are filling a wheel barrow with clothing. If they remain unaware of intruders they will take the full wheel barrow to the furnace in Room 7. The pile’s content is mostly ruined but searching reveals d6x10gp, a flask of oil, and a fine striped gentleman’s suit worth 20gp.</p>
<h3 id="the-childrens-feast">6. The Children’s Feast</h3>
<p>Five Black-Eyed Children feast on a corpse. Many gnawed bones are strewn about the room. Piles of straw and fabric make a filthy nest where an additional Black-Eyed Child sleeps.</p>
<h3 id="the-kitchen">7. The Kitchen</h3>
<p>Smoke from a burning iron stove darkens the air. A cauldron of boiling water and bones sits on top of the stove. A Crimson Monk tends to the cauldron, stirring and adding in blood from a bucket by his feet. If he doesn’t notice intruders, in 10 minutes he will take a pitcher of the soup to Room 8 and pour it in the mouth of the Manticore statue. If he fails to feed the statue in one hour it will shed its stone shell and befcome a real manticore.</p>
<h3 id="shrine-of-the-manticore">8. Shrine of the Manticore</h3>
<p>A vicious looking Manticore statue in mid roar dominates the room. It’s stone mouth stained with blood. Thick chains twisted around the statue and connect to the wall. The statue is the petrified form of Mulsevnious, a very old and wicked Manticore of legend. It must be fed with a special potion the Crimson Cult is tasked with creating or it will shed it’s stone shell and become a real Manticore</p>
<h3 id="the-crimson-vault">9. The Crimson Vault</h3>
<p>A large shelf of books and book fragments in esoteric languages. Searching the room yields a healing potion, 3 scrolls containing random spells, 2d6 white robes, not yet stained with blood, a bag of gemstomes worth 300 gp and a gold spider idol worth 200GP. A large book on a desk details the history of the Crimson Cult:</p>
<ul>
<li>Founding magician summoned Mulsevnious. They battled for hours until the Magician turned the Manticore to stone.</li>
<li>250 years ago, the magician created a potion to extend the petrification spell. It must but repeated twice a month to keep the spell working.</li>
<li>Crimson Cult was started to keep the Manticore trapped.</li>
<li>The Cult began kidnapping travelers to sacrifice to the Manticore.</li>
<li>5 years ago the cult tamed the Black-Eyed Children and began using them hunt travelers for the potion.</li>
</ul>
